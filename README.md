# Global_Store_Analysis_Python
# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights based on historical data from a global store. Using Python's powerful libraries, we explore, clean, and visualize the data to identify patterns and trends in sales, products, and customer behavior.

# Dataset
The dataset used contains global sales data, including:

# Product Categories
# Regions
Order Dates
# Sales, Profit, and Discount Metrics
# Customer Segments
The data was pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers, and other issues for better accuracy during analysis.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
Python: Core language for analysis
Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and running the code
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy: For mathematical computations
Matplotlib: For data visualizations
Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations
Plotly: For interactive plots (optional)
# Features
# Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, outliers, and standardizing the dataset.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing key metrics and plotting sales trends.
# Visualizations:
Sales and Profit by Region and Category
Year-over-Year Sales Trends
Correlation between Discounts and Profit
Customer Segmentation Analysis
# Insights: Extracting actionable insights to optimize sales, pricing strategies, and inventory management.
# Some key insights derived from the analysis:
# Sales Trends: Seasonal and regional variations in sales.
# Profit Margins: Which product categories offer the highest profitability.
# Discount Strategy: Analyzing how discounts affect profit margins.
# Customer Segmentation: Identifying the most profitable customer segments.
Visualizations include sales over time, profit by region, and more. The use of Matplotlib and Seaborn allows for clear and intuitive visualizations, while Plotly offers interactive exploration.
